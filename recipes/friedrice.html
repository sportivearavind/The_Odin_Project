    <h1>Friedrice</h1>
    <img src="../images/friedrice.jpg" alt="friedrice image">
    <p>Chicken fried rice is a popular dish in many Asian cuisines, particularly in Chinese and Thai cuisine. It typically consists of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or pan with chopped chicken, eggs, vegetables (such as peas, carrots, and onions), and seasonings (such as soy sauce, garlic, and ginger).</p>
    <p>To make chicken fried rice, the rice is usually first cooked and cooled to reduce its moisture content, making it easier to fry. The chicken is then typically diced into small pieces and cooked in a separate pan until it is fully cooked and slightly browned.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>3 cups cooked white rice (preferably chilled)</li>
